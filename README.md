# -CAR-DEKHO-AI-End-to-End-used-car-Indian-price-prediction-web-app-
I have processed , and prepared a data and trained a Xgboost model to find the price of used car , then I have also used flask , html and css to show it on the browser 

the two dataset I have provided are are the only Idian used car price data I could get my hands on , out of which I have only used train_data.csv for both traing and testing if you want you can try test_data as well but it has no relevent information or output to check whether the model has predicted correct or not so it's completley useless
